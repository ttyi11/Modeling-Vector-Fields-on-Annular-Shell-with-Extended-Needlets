# Modeling-Vector-Fields-on-Annular-Shell-with-Extended-Needlets

This repository is for the project "Modeling Vector Fields on an Annular Shell and its Application to Lithospheric Magnetic Fields". It contains two main functions

- get_design_matrix: construction design matrix from the extend needlets
- MCMC: fit the corresponding models

An simple simulation example is added in sim.py.
